# AHB---to---APB---Bridge---Verification
UVM-based verification of AHB-to-APB bridge in SystemVerilog, built at Maven Silicon (2024â€“25). Tests AHB-APB data transfers with 95% coverage using constrained-random stimuli, scoreboarding, and assertions. Simulated with Synopsys VCS, debugged via Verdi, showing SystemVerilog and UVM skills for SoC verification.
